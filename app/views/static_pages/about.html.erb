    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      We are sculptors, composers, playwrights and thespians. Born from a group of artists, Peanuts is open source ticket sales platform. Artists make the content and we sell the tickets. It sounds so straightforward, right?

    <h2>What We Want</h2>
    <p>
      We want artists to receive the best visibility with no extra fees or stress. We want a platform for easy browsing and no hassle ticket purchases. We want artists to put on a performance and people to enjoy it. We are constantly working to streamline our users experience and stay true to our mission. It is no fuss on your part and thatâ€™s what we intended.
